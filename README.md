# 💫 About Me:
💻 I'm Muhammad Saleh, a skilled front-end developer currently working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, WordPress, and the MERN stack (React, Node.js, MongoDB). I have experience in converting prototypes (Figma, XD, PSD) into fully custom-coded websites. I pride myself on delivering responsive, user-friendly websites that captivate audiences.
<br><br>
🤝 I am looking to collaborate on custom website development projects, especially in business, real estate, and portfolio niches. Whether it’s creating functional landing pages or redesigning and duplicating websites, I excel in crafting seamless web experiences on freelancing platforms like Upwork.
<br><br>
🔧 I’m eager to help with website optimization, fixing bugs, and improving site functionality while ensuring that websites not only look great but perform flawlessly. I also offer basic on-page SEO to enhance visibility.
<br><br>
📚 Currently, I’m expanding my skills by learning React, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I’m always excited to explore more programming languages to sharpen my expertise.
<br><br>
❓ Feel free to ask me about my experience in website redesigns, prototype conversions, and WordPress development. I’m passionate about delivering high-quality results for every project I undertake.
<br><br>
🎉 I've built multiple landing pages and functional websites across various niches, and I’m passionate about combining aesthetics with performance to deliver the best results for my clients.
